# RushHour - The Appointment Platform

Overview

Rush Hour is appointment scheduling software. It can be used in various areas, i.e., medical services, beauty and wellness, sport, etc. It supports business accounts for providers of service, and individual ones - for the clients who can make appointments.

SpeciÔ¨Åcation

Rush Hour is a RESTful API with a layered architecture, using a relational database for its persistence layer. The required layers are: 
- data access, 
- business, 
- presentation 
but could not be limited to these layers only. All the business logic should be tested with unit tests, and optionally - integration tests.
